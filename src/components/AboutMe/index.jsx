                    I am a budding Web Developer with a Bachelors of Science Degree in Management. I have recently earned a certificate in full stack development from University of California San Diego. In this program I developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React.js, and more.

                    I used to be in the sales industry but ended up moving to California to try and break into a new industry. I am very passionate about computers, programming, and web development. I am also passionate about gaming, and it is my hope to one day break into the gaming industry as a developer of some sort.
